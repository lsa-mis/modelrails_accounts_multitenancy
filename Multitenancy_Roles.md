## AccountRole:

Each account has a role. Roles are used to deliniate what actions are allowed on resources. Here are the default roles that are available within our syswtems by default (or configuration?). They are broken down by the scope that they are associated with. 


Basic Roles
>  - Read: Can read and clone this resource.
>  - Write: Can read, clone, and push to this resource.
>  Can also manage issues and pull requests.
>  - Maintain: Can read, clone, and update this resource. [* If the resource is a single entitity, versus if it is a collection?] They can also and some resource settings.
>  - Owner: Can read, clone, and update this resource. Owners also manage resource settings, including adding collaborators.

  ### Application
  
  Application owners have complete administrative access to your application. This role should be limited, but to no less than two people, in your organization.
  
    - adding account owners, departments and roles. 
    - editing content on application itself (landing page, about us, etc...) (if enabled).

  
  By default, the admins will be W&ADS Rails team. The tasks will generally be done using the console? (**Initially?)
  
  > [MCommunity Method](MCommunity.md)
    When creating a new application, create a MCommunity group folloing the pattern ```appname-admins``` and add the ```lsa-was-rails-admins``` group to it.
